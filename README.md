# Reactive Programming With Java 9
This is the code repository for [Reactive Programming With Java 9](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/reactive-programming-java-9?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787124233), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Technology currently plays a major role in the success of a business, and it has become ever more important for applications that enable or support the business to become responsive, resilient, and elastic. Reactive programming is a programming model that helps you tackle the essential complexity that comes with writing such applications.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders.

Chapters 1,9, and 11 do not have any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
  public static interface Flow.Subscription {   
      public void  request(long n);   
      public void  cancel() ;   
  } 
```

The most important thing you need to go with reactive programming is practical knowledge of Java. Any person who has basic practical knowledge of JDK can start with reactive programming. The practical knowledge of JDK 8 will be an added advantage to go ahead. You will need the basic knowledge of JDK 9 as we are using it for development throughout the book. The basic knowledge of multithreading, JUnit, RESTFul web services, and Spring Framework 5.0 will be an added advantage. Practical knowledge of Eclipse IDE is required as we will be using it throughout the book.
